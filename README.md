# Kreo Canvas – Web Page Brush & Shape Overlay

Kreo Canvas adds a floating drawing canvas to any webpage: freehand brush, clean shapes, quick annotation, export PNG/JSON. Perfect for:

- Explaining product ideas during calls
- Marking up UI/UX feedback quickly
- Teaching & live walkthroughs

Open the extension, sketch what you mean, export or screenshot, and move on—no context switching.

## Key Use Cases
